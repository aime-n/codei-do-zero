Title: When You're Gone

Original Music: Queen - Friends Will Be Friends

Song Lyrics:

When you're gone, I'm alone
I reach for you, but you're not around
Just an empty space, a void in my heart
Where did you go?

Time can't heal this pain
No matter how hard I try, I can't escape the memories
Every little thing reminds me of you

I wish I could turn back time
To make things right, to bring you back
But all I can do is hope and pray
That one day, you'll come back to me

 chorus:
When you're gone, I'm alone
But I keep your memory alive
Every beat of my heart, I long for your touch
And even though you're gone, I still feel you

I know you're out there somewhere
And I hope you're doing well
Remembering the times we had, the good and the bad
Just know that I'm here, waiting for you

When you're gone, I'm alone (I'm alone)
I'm doing my best to carry on
But no matter how hard I try, I'm still feeling alone
It's hard to be strong when you're not here

I'm lost without your guiding light
I'm trying to find my way, I'm feeling a little bit lost
But I know that I'll find my way back to you

Just know that I love you
And I hope that you love me too
We may be apart for now, but our love will stay true
And even though we're apart, you're always in my heart

When you come back to me
When you come back to me

When you're back, everything will be fine
We'll pick up right where we left off, it'll be so divine
I'll be waiting for you, with a love so strong
That nothing can keep us apart, not even time

If you ever leave me, I'll be lost
But I'll keep holding on, hoping that you'll come back to me
You're the light in my darkened sky
And I don't want this feeling to end

When you're gone, I'm alone
But I know that our love will stay alive
And even though we're apart, I'll keep holding on to you
