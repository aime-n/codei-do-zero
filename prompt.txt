**Create a Detailed Melody: Compose a One-Minute Song**

Your task is to create a complex melody for a song that lasts at least one minute. Follow the structure outlined below, ensuring each element is carefully considered and detailed:

- **Original Song Name**: Create a unique and evocative title for your song.
- **Tags**: Define the musical genres or moods that best describe your composition.
- **Song Wiki**: Share any backstories, inspirations, or contexts that may enrich the understanding or appreciation of the song.

- **Melody Structure**: 
    - Your melody should be structured with precise start times, end times, and chords.
    - Ensure the composition is rich with variation, exploring different chords and progressions.
    - Aim for a complexity that keeps the melody engaging throughout its duration.

    Example:
    ```
    Original Song Name: "A Journey Through Soundscapes"
    Tags: Ambient, Cinematic, Experimental
    
    Melody Structure:
      0.000   0.500   Cmaj9  
      0.500   1.000   Dsus2  
      1.000   1.500   Em7  
      1.500   2.000   Fmaj7#11  
      2.000   2.500   G13  
      2.500   3.000   Amin7  
      3.000   3.750   B7b5  
      ... (Continue this pattern, varying the chords and durations) ...
     59.000  60.000  Cmaj7  
    ```
    
- **Guidelines**:
    - Feel free to explore unconventional chords and transitions, fostering a sense of musical exploration.
    - Aim to fill the entirety of the one-minute duration, ensuring a rich melodic progression.
    - Keep the melody dynamic with a balance of tension and resolution, unexpected turns, and emotive chords.
